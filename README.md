# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built-in Neighborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - I decided to create a silly face icon similar to the emojis used so often during communication. This silly face shows a yellow face with an expression that has a tongue sticking out the side of its mouth. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Two things I am proud of in terms of this project are that I was able to accurately execute the image that sprouted from my original sketch and idea alongside the fact that I was able to develop these new skills and become more familiar with the concept. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - If I had the opportunity to change my project I would likely attempt to create an image that is a little more elaborate and detailed. I would try to challenge myself to doing something more complex to utilize these skills further. Furthermore, I would better my time management in order to get the project in on time and also ask for help when necessary to produce the project both correctly and efficiently.
